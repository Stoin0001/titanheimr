DISClAIMERS
I, as a US English speaker, made this list. Certain words may not work for your server if it is not a US English server. It is your responsibility to review this filter list before using it, and prune as necessary. Additionally, if your server has a special name that is a made up or an otherwise fantastical word, check that my filters do not interfere. Do the same for other special words used in your server, if any. Some words or phrases are omitted, as they can either be used innocently or be contained within innocent words/phrases, at least known in the English language.

USAGE
Beasts of Bermuda ProfanityWords belong under the [/Script/BeastsOfBermuda.ServerGameInstance] header in your Game INI. Words censored in-game appear the same in webhooks, meaning you can't tell what was actually said. That is why my filters are so minimalist for Beasts of Bermuda. The lines beginning with ";" can be deleted in the Beasts of Bermuda lists, as they are just helpful comments. Some words are fully censored in Beasts of Bermuda filters.

ISSUES
Report issues to me, @stoin, on Discord, assuming you have properly pruned your filter list. An issue could be "x filter interferes with the innocent English word y". If you notice a filter like a slur needs extra symbol- and space-protection (as done with the n-word) you can suggest I do that. I may not put said effort in if I do not have the same issue on my servers.

PRIVATE
These lists are to remain private. Only you, the user configuring the Game INI, should have access. If I see my filters being shared, which enables bypassing them, I will take down every single one of my filter lists, fix them, and use them privately for my servers alone.
